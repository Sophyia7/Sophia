# Hello there! 👋 👩🏽‍💻


Hi! I'm Sophia Iroegbu, a self-taught Python developer with a strong focus on cloud technologies (Azure), containerization (Docker), and technical writing. I began my coding journey in 2020 and entered the professional field in 2021. I’m also experienced in Developer Relations (DevRel), where I engage with tech communities, create educational resources, and help developers succeed with practical tools and solutions.

👩‍💻 On this GitHub, you'll find projects related to Python, DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and technical tutorials I’ve written. I’m passionate about simplifying complex concepts, sharing knowledge, and fostering growth within developer communities.


💬 I share insights and experiences on my [blog](http://sophyia.me/), covering Python, Backend Development, APIs, and Django. Whether you're looking for advice or tech discussions, I'm here for it!

Passionate about building impactful projects with Python and Django and sharing knowledge through DevRel, speaking, and technical writing. Let's collaborate and create something great!
