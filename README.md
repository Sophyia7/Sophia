# Hello there! üëã üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª


I'm Sophia, a self-taught backend engineer and technical writer from Africa/Nigeria. I find immense joy in transforming abstract ideas into robust backend systems. With over 3 years of hands-on experience in crafting and implementing software solutions that amplify end-user experiences, I've honed my skills in Python-based backend development and technical documentation.

My journey in technology has been shaped by three pillars: Logic, Communication, and Teamwork. These strengths have been instrumental in navigating the dynamic landscapes of backend engineering and community advocacy.

Here are a few things that light up my tech-centric world:

- **Planning**
- **Building structures**
- **Designing systems**: 
- **Learning new technologies**

In addition to my backend engineering skills, I'm equally passionate about community building and developer advocacy. As a developer advocate, I write code and cultivate inclusive and vibrant developer communities where knowledge-sharing and collaboration thrive. Through workshops, meetups, and online forums, I aim to empower developers, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, to unlock their full potential and make meaningful contributions to the tech ecosystem.

üíº If you're looking for a seasoned Backend (Python) software engineer who excels in crafting RESTful APIs and thrives on technical documentation, I'm here and eager to collaborate! Feel free to contact me via this [email](mailto:iroegbusophia3@gmail.com).

üí¨ I also curate insights and share experiences on my [blog](http://sophyia.me/), delving into topics ranging from Python and Backend Development to APIs and Django. Whether you seek advice or want to dive into tech discussions, I'm all ears!

Let's connect, collaborate, and code together towards a brighter, more inclusive tech future.
